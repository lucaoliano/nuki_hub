## About

***The scope of Nuki Hub is to have an efficient way to integrate Nuki devices in a local Home Automation platform.***

The Nuki Hub software runs on a ESP32 module and acts as a bridge between Nuki devices and a Home Automation platform.<br>
<br>
It communicates with a Nuki Lock and/or Opener through Bluetooth (BLE) and uses MQTT to integrate with other systems.<br>
<br>
It exposes the lock state (and much more) through MQTT and allows executing commands like locking and unlocking through MQTT.<br>

***Nuki Hub does not integrate with the Nuki mobile app, it can't register itself as a bridge in the official Nuki mobile app.***

## Supported devices

<b>Supported ESP32 devices:</b>
- All dual-core ESP32 models with WIFI and BLE which are supported by Arduino Core 2.0.15 should work, but builds are currently only provided for the ESP32 and not for the ESP32-S3 or ESP32-C3.
- The ESP32-S2 has no BLE and as such can't run Nuki Hub.
- The ESP32-C6 and ESP32-H2 are not supported by Arduino Core 2.0.15 as such can't run Nuki Hub (at this time).

- [M5Stack PoESP32 Unit](https://docs.m5stack.com/en/unit/poesp32)
- [LilyGO-T-ETH-POE](https://github.com/Xinyuan-LilyGO/LilyGO-T-ETH-POE)

<b>Note for users upgrading from Nuki Hub 8.21 or lower:</b><br>
Please go to "MQTT and Network Configuration" and select "Wi-Fi only" as the network device (unless you use other network hardware).

## Installation

Flash the firmware to an ESP32. The easiest way to install is to use the web installer using a compatible browser like Chrome/Opera/Edge:<br>
https://technyon.github.io/nuki_hub/<br>
<br>
Alternatively download the latest release from https://github.com/technyon/nuki_hub/releases<br>
Unpack the 7z archive and read the included readme.txt for installation instructions for either "Espressif Flash Download Tools" or "esptool".

## Initial setup (Network and MQTT)

Power up the ESP32 and a new Wi-Fi access point named "ESP32_(8 CHARACTER ALPHANUMERIC)" should appear.<br>
Connect a client device to this access point and in a browser navigate to "http://192.168.4.1".<br>
Use the web interface to connect the ESP to your preferred Wi-Fi network.<br>
<br>
After configuring Wi-Fi, the ESP should automatically connect to your network.<br>
<br>
To configure the connection to the MQTT broker first connect your client device to the same Wi-Fi network the ESP32 is connected to.<br>
In a browser navigate to the IP address assigned to the ESP32 via DHCP (often found in the web interface of your internet router).<br><br>
Next click on "Edit" below "MQTT and Network Configuration" and enter the address and port (usually 1883) of your MQTT broker and a username and a password if required by your MQTT broker.<br>
<br>
The firmware supports SSL encryption for MQTT, however most people and especially home users don't use this.<br>
In that case leave all fields starting with "MQTT SSL" blank. Otherwise see the "MQTT Encryption" section of this README.

## Pairing with a Nuki Lock or Opener

Enable pairing mode on the Nuki Lock or Opener (press the button on the Nuki device for a few seconds) and power on the ESP32.<br>
Pairing should be automatic.<br>
<br>
When pairing is successful, the web interface should show "Paired: Yes" (it might be necessary to reload the page in your browser).<br>
MQTT nodes like lock state and battery level should now reflect the reported values from the lock.<br>
<br>
<b>Note: It is possible to run Nuki Hub alongside a Nuki Bridge. 
This is not recommended and will lead to excessive battery drain and can lead to either device missing updates.
Enable "Register as app" before pairing to allow this. Otherwise the Bridge will be unregistered when pairing the Nuki Hub.</b>

## Configuration

In a browser navigate to the IP address assigned to the ESP32.

### MQTT and Network Configuration 

#### Basic MQTT and Network Configuration

- Host name: Set the hostname for the Nuki Hub ESP
- MQTT Broker: Set to the IP address of the MQTT broker
- MQTT Broker port: Set to the Port of the MQTT broker (usually 1883)
- MQTT User: If using authentication on the MQTT broker set to a username with read/write rights on the MQTT broker, set to # to clear
- MQTT Password : If using authentication on the MQTT broker set to the password belonging to a username with read/write rights on the MQTT broker, set to # to clear

#### Advanced MQTT and Network Configuration

- Home Assistant discovery topic: Set to the Home Assistant auto discovery topic, leave empty to disable auto discovery. Usually "homeassistant" unless you manually changed this setting on the Home Assistant side.
- Home Assistant device configuration URL: When using Home Assistant discovery the link to the Nuki Hub Web Configuration will be published to Home Assistant. By default when this setting is left empty this will link to the current IP of the Nuki Hub. When using a reverse proxy to access the Web Configuration you can set a custom URL here.
- Set Nuki Opener Lock/Unlock action in Home Assistant to Continuous mode (Opener only): By default the lock entity in Home Assistant will enable Ring-to-Open (RTO) when unlocking and disable RTO when locking. By enabling this setting this behaviour will change and now unlocking will enable Continuous Mode and locking will disable Continuous Mode, for more information see the "Home Assistant Discovery" section of this README. 
- MQTT SSL CA Certificate: Optionally set to the CA SSL certificate of the MQTT broker, see the "MQTT Encryption" section of this README.
- MQTT SSL Client Certificate: Optionally set to the Client SSL certificate of the MQTT broker, see the "MQTT Encryption" section of this README.
- MQTT SSL Client Key: Optionally set to the Client SSL key of the MQTT broker, see the "MQTT Encryption" section of this README.
- Network hardware: "Wi-Fi only" by default, set to one of the specified ethernet modules if available, see the "Supported Ethernet devices" and "Connecting via Ethernet" section of this README.
- Disable fallback to Wi-Fi / Wi-Fi config portal: By default the Nuki Hub will fallback to Wi-Fi and open the Wi-Fi configuration portal when the network connection fails. Enable this setting to disable this fallback.
- RSSI Publish interval: Set to a positive integer to set the amount of seconds between updates to the maintenance/wifiRssi MQTT topic with the current Wi-Fi RSSI, set to -1 to disable, default 60. 
- Network Timeout until restart: Set to a positive integer to restart the Nuki Hub after the set amount of seconds has passed without an active connection to the MQTT broker, set to -1 to disable, default 60.
- Restart on disconnect: Enable to restart the Nuki Hub after 60 seconds without a connection to a network.
- Enable MQTT logging: Enable to fill the maintenance/log MQTT topic with debug log information.
- Check for Firmware Updates every 24h: Enable to allow the Nuki Hub to check the latest release of the Nuki Hub firmware on boot and every 24 hours. Requires the Nuki Hub to be able to connect to github.com. The latest version will be published to MQTT and will be visible on the main page of the Web Configurator.

#### IP Address assignment

- Enable DHCP: Enable to use DHCP for obtaining an IP address, disable to use the static IP settings below
- Static IP address: When DHCP is disabled set to the preferred static IP address for the Nuki Hub to use
- Subnet: When DHCP is disabled set to the preferred subnet for the Nuki Hub to use

### Nuki Configuration

#### Basic Nuki Configuration

- Nuki Smartlock enabled: Enable if you want Nuki Hub to connect to a Nuki Lock (1.0-4.0)
- MQTT Nuki Smartlock Path (Lock only): Set to the preferred MQTT root topic for the Nuki Lock, defaults to "nuki". Make sure this topic is not the same as the setting for the opener and is unique when using multiple Nuki Hub devices (when using multiple Nuki Locks)
- Nuki Opener enabled: Enable if you want Nuki Hub to connect to a Nuki Opener
- MQTT Nuki Opener Path (Opener only): Set to the preferred MQTT root topic for the Nuki Opener, defaults to "nukiopener". Make sure this topic is not the same as the setting for the lock and is unique when using multiple Nuki Hub devices (when using multiple Nuki Openers)

#### Advanced Nuki Configuration

- Query interval lock state: Set to a positive integer to set the maximum amount of seconds between actively querying the Nuki device for the current lock state, default 1800.
- Query interval configuration: Set to a positive integer to set the maximum amount of seconds between actively querying the Nuki device for the current configuration, default 3600.
- Query interval battery: Set to a positive integer to set the maximum amount of seconds between actively querying the Nuki device for the current battery state, default 1800.
- Query interval keypad (Only available when a Keypad is detected): Set to a positive integer to set the maximum amount of seconds between actively querying the Nuki device for the current keypad state, default 1800.
- Number of retries if command failed: Set to a positive integer to define the amount of times the Nuki Hub retries sending commands to the Nuki Lock or Opener when commands are not acknowledged by the device, default 3.
- Delay between retries: Set to the amount of milliseconds the Nuki Hub waits between resending not acknowledged commands, default 100.
- Nuki Bridge is running alongside Nuki Hub: Enable to allow Nuki Hub to co-exist with a Nuki Bridge by registering Nuki Hub as an (smartphone) app instead of a bridge. Changing this setting will require re-pairing. Enabling this setting is strongly discouraged as described in the "Pairing with a Nuki Lock or Opener" section of this README
- Presence detection timeout: Set to a positive integer to set the amount of seconds between updates to the presence/devices MQTT topic with the list of detected bluetooth devices, set to -1 to disable presence detection, default 60.
- Restart if bluetooth beacons not received: Set to a positive integer to restart the Nuki Hub after the set amount of seconds has passed without receiving a bluetooth beacon from the Nuki device, set to -1 to disable, default 60. Because the bluetooth stack of the ESP32 can silently fail it is not recommended to disable this setting.

## Over-the-air Update (OTA)

After the initial installation of the Nuki Hub firmware via serial connection, further updates can be deployed via OTA update from a browser.<br>
In the configuration portal, scroll down to "Firmware update" and click "Open".<br>
Then Click "Browse" and select the new "nuki_hub.bin" file and select "Upload file".<br>
After about a minute the new firmware should be installed.

## MQTT Encryption (optional; Wi-Fi and LAN8720 only)

The communication via MQTT can be SSL encrypted.<br>
To enable SSL encryption, supply the necessary information in the MQTT Configuration page.<br>
<br>
The following configurations are supported:<br>
CA, CERT and KEY are empty -> No encryption<br>
CA is filled but CERT and KEY are empty -> Encrypted MQTT<br>
CA, CERT and KEY are filled -> Encrypted MQTT with client vaildation

## Home Assistant Discovery (optional)

This software supports [MQTT Discovery](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/mqtt/discovery/) for integrating Nuki Hub with Home Assistant.<br>
To enable autodiscovery, supply the discovery topic that is configured in your Home Assistant instance (If you have not changed this setting in Home Assistant the default is "homeassistant") in the MQTT Configuration page.<br>
Once enabled, the Nuki Lock and/or Opener and related entities should automatically appear in your Home Assistant MQTT devices.

The following mapping between Home Assistant services and Nuki commands is setup when enabling autodiscovery:
|             | Smartlock | Opener (default)          | Opener (alternative)      |
|-------------|-----------|---------------------------|---------------------------|
| lock.lock   | Lock      | Disable Ring To Open      | Disable Continuous Mode   |
| lock.unlock | Unlock    | Enable Ring To Open       | Enable Continuous Mode    |
| lock.open   | Unlatch   | Electric Strike Actuation | Electric Strike Actuation |

NOTE: MQTT Discovery uses retained MQTT messages to store devices configurations. In order to avoid orphan configurations on your broker please disable autodiscovery first if you no longer want to use this SW. Retained messages are automatically cleared when unpairing and when changing/disabling autodiscovery topic in MQTT Configuration page.<br>
NOTE2: Home Assistant can be setup manually using the [MQTT Lock integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/lock.mqtt/), but this is not recommended

## Keypad control using JSON (optional)

If a keypad is connected to the lock, keypad codes can be added, updated and removed. This has to enabled first in the configuration portal. Check "Add, modify and delete keypad codes" under "Access Level Configuration" and save the configuration.

Information about current keypad codes is published as JSON data to the "keypad/json" MQTT topic.<br>
This needs to be enabled separately by checking "Publish keypad codes information" under "Access Level Configuration" and saving the configuration.
For security reasons, the code itself is not published.

To change Nuki Lock/Opener keypad settings set the `keypad/actionJson` topic to a JSON formatted value containing the following nodes.

| Node             | Delete   | Add      | Update   | Usage                                                                                    | Possible values                                                |

- Add: `{ "action": "add", "code": "589472", "name": "Test", "timeLimited": "1", "allowedFrom": "2024-04-12 10:00:00", "allowedUntil": "2034-04-12 10:00:00", "allowedWeekdays": [ "wed", "thu", "fri" ], "allowedFromTime": "08:00", "allowedUntilTime": "16:00" }`
- Update: `{ "action": "update", "codeId": "1234", "code": "589472", "enabled": "1", "name": "Test", "timeLimited": "1", "allowedFrom": "2024-04-12 10:00:00", "allowedUntil": "2034-04-12 10:00:00", "allowedWeekdays": [ "mon", "tue", "sat", "sun" ], "allowedFromTime": "08:00", "allowedUntilTime": "16:00" }`

### Result of attempted keypad code changes

The result of the last configuration change action will be published to the `configuration/commandResultJson` MQTT topic.<br>
Possible values are "noPinSet", "keypadControlDisabled", "keypadNotAvailable", "keypadDisabled", "invalidConfig", "invalidJson", "noActionSet", "invalidAction", "noExistingCodeIdSet", "noNameSet", "noValidCodeSet", "noCodeSet", "invalidAllowedFrom", "invalidAllowedUntil", "invalidAllowedFromTime", "invalidAllowedUntilTime", "success", "failed", "timeOut", "working", "notPaired", "error" and "undefined".<br>
 
## Keypad control (alternative, optional)

If a keypad is connected to the lock, keypad codes can be added, updated and removed.
This has to enabled first in the configuration portal. Check "Add, modify and delete keypad codes" under "Access Level Configuration" and save the configuration.

Information about codes is published under "keypad/code_x", x starting from 0 up the number of configured codes. This needs to be enabled separately by checking "Publish keypad codes information" under "Access Level Configuration" and saving the configuration.
For security reasons, the code itself is not published. To modify keypad codes, a command
structure is setup under keypad/command:

- keypad/command/id: The id of an existing code, found under keypad_code_x
- keypad/command/name: Display name of the code
- keypad/command/code: The actual 6-digit keypad code
- keypad/command/enabled: Set to 1 to enable the code, 0 to disable
- keypad/command/action: The action to execute. Possible values are add, delete and update

To modify keypad codes, the first four parameter nodes have to be set depending on the command:

- To add a code, set name, code, enabled **
- To delete a code, set id
- To update a code, set id, name, code, enabled

** Note: Rules for codes are:
- The code must be a 6 digit number
- The code can't contain 0
- The code can't start with 12

After setting the necessary parameters, write the action to be executed to the command node.
For example, to add a code:
- write "John Doe" to name
- write 111222 to code
- write 1 to enabled
- write "add" to action

## GPIO lock control (optional)

The lock can be controlled via GPIO.<br>
<br>
To enable GPIO control, go the the "GPIO Configuration" page where each GPIO can be configured for a specific role:
- Disabled: The GPIO is disabled
- Input: Lock: When connect to Ground, a lock command is sent to the lock
- Input: Unlock: When connect to Ground, an unlock command is sent to the lock
- Input: Unlatch: When connect to Ground, an unlatch command is sent to the lock
- Input: Lock n Go: When connect to Ground, a Lock n Go command is sent to the lock
- Input: Lock n Go and unlatch: When connect to Ground, a Lock n Go and unlatch command is sent to the lock
- Input: Electric strike actuation: When connect to Ground, an electric strike actuation command is sent to the opener (open door for configured amount of time)
- Input: Activate RTO: When connect to Ground, Ring-to-open is activated (opener)
- Input: Activate CM: When connect to Ground, Continuous mode is activated (opener)
- Input: Deactivate RTO/CM: Disable RTO or CM, depending on which is active (opener)
- Input: Dectivate RTO: When connect to Ground, Ring-to-open is deactivated (opener)
- Input: Dectivate CM: When connect to Ground, Continuous mode is deactivated (opener)
- Output: High when locked: Outputs a high signal when the door is locked
- Output: High when unlocked: Outputs a high signal when the door is unlocked
- Output: High when motor blocked: Outputs a high signal when the motor is blocked (lock)
- Output: High when RTO active: Outputs a high signal when ring-to-open is active (opener)
- Output: High when CM active: Outputs a high signal when continuous mode is active (opener)
- Output: High when RTO or CM active: Outputs a high signal when either ring-to-open or continuous mode is active (opener)
- General input (pull-down): The pin is configured in pull-down configuration and its state is published to the "gpio/pin_x/state" topic
- General input (pull-up): The pin is configured in pull-up configuration and its state is published to the "gpio/pin_x/state" topic
- Genral output: The pin is set to high or low depending on the "gpio/pin_x/state" topic

Note: The old setting "Enable control via GPIO" is removed. If you had enabled this setting before upgrading to 8.22, the PINs are automatically configured to be compatible with the previously hard-coded PINs.

## Connecting via Ethernet (Optional)

If you prefer to connect to the MQTT Broker via Ethernet instead of Wi-Fi, you either use one of the supported ESP32 modules (see about section above),
or wire a seperate Wiznet W5x00 Module (W5100, W5200, W5500 are supported). To use a supported module, flash the firmware, connect via Wi-Fi and
select the correct network hardware in the MQTT and network settings section.

To wire an external W5x00 module to the ESP, use this wiring scheme:

- Connect W5x00 to ESP32 SPI0:<br>
  - W5x00 SCK to GPIO18<br>
  - W5x00 MISO to GPIO19<br>
  - W5x00 MOSI to GPIO23<br>
  - W5x00 CS/SS to GPIO5<br>
- Optionally connect:<br>
  - W5x00 reset to GPIO33<br>

Now connect via Wi-Fi and change the network hardware to "Generic W5500".<br>
If the W5500 hwardware isn't detected, Wi-Fi is used as a fallback.<br>
<br>
Note: Encrypted MQTT is only available for Wi-Fi and LAN8720 modules, W5x00 modules don't support encryption<br>
(that leaves Olimex, WT32-ETH01 and M5Stack PoESP32 Unit if encryption is desired).<br>
<br>
If encryption is needed, Olimex is the easiest option, since it has USB for flashing onboard.

## Troubleshooting

### Random Wi-Fi disconnects

Unfortunately the ESP32 has problems with some access points and reconnecting fails.<br>
As a workaround you can navigate to "MQTT and Network Configuration" and enable "Restart on disconnect".<br>
This will reboot the ESP as soon as it gets disconnected from Wi-Fi.<br>
Also, this reduces the config portal timeout to three minutes to prevent the ESP being stuck in config mode in case an access point is offline temporarily.<br>
If this still doesn't fix the disconnects and the ESP becomes unreachable, the "Restart timer" option can be used as a last resort.<br>
It will restart the ESP after a configured amount of time.

### Pairing with the lock (or opener) doesn't work

First, make sure the firmware version of the Nuki device is up-to-date, older versions have issues pairing.<br>
Next, try erasing the ESP32 flash and then (re-)flash the firmware.<br>
To erase the flash, use the espressif download tool and click the "Erase" button.<br>
Afterwards flash the firmware as described in the readme within the 7z file.<br>
<br>

Also, there are reports that ESP32 "DEVKIT1" module don't work and pairing is not possible. The reason is unknown, but if you use such a module, try a different one.<br>
<br>
Reported as working are:
- [M5Stack ATOM Lite](https://shop.m5stack.com/products/atom-lite-esp32-development-kit)
- ESP32-WROOM-32D (DEVKIT V4)
- ESP32-WROOM-32E

For more information check the related issue: https://github.com/technyon/nuki_hub/issues/39

Also, check that pairing is allowed. In the Nuki smartphone app, go to "Settings" --> "Features & Configuration" --> "Button & LED" and make sure "Bluetooh Pairing" is enabled.

A note about the [M5Stack PoESP32 Unit](https://docs.m5stack.com/en/unit/poesp32). Here the initial Bluetooth reception is very poor (range less than one meter). The reason is that the module does not have an antenna on the PCB, but only an IPEX connector. By retrofitting an external SMA antenna (IPEX, or other names U.FL, IPAX, IPX, AMC, MHF, UMCC), bluetooth/Wifi works over several meters.

### In Home Assistant, the lock/opener is shown as unavailable

Make sure you are using at least version 2023.8.0 of Home Assistant.<br>
The Home Assistant developers have made changes to MQTT auto discovery which break support for older version and Nuki Hub has adopted these changes.<br>
This unfortunately means that older versions of Home Assistant are not supported by the Nuki Hub discovery implemenation anymore.

## FAQ

### Nuki Hub doesn't work when Wi-Fi on a Nuki Smartlock Pro (3.0 / 4.0) is turned on.

According to Nuki this is by design and part of the specification of the Pro lock.<br>
You can use either the built-in Wi-Fi or a Bridge (which Nuki Hub registers as).<br>
Using both at the same time is not supported.

### Certain functionality doesn't work (e. g. changing configuration, setting keypad codes)

Some functionality is restricted by the Lock (or Opener) firmware and is only accessible when the PIN is provided.<br>
When setting up the lock (or opener), you have to set a PIN in the Nuki smartphone app.<br>
Navigate to the Nuki Hub Credentials page, enter this PIN and click save.

### Authorization data isn't published

See the previous point, this functionality needs the correct PIN to be configured.

### Using Home Assistant, it's only possible to lock or unlock the door, but not to unlatch it

Make sure "Access level" under "Advanced Nuki Configuration" is set to "Full".<br>
<br>
Unlatching can be triggered using the lock.open service.<br>
<br>
Alternatively an "Unlatch" button is exposed through Home Assistant discovery.<br>
This button is disabled by default, but can be enabled in the Home Assistant UI.

### When controlling two locks (or openers) connected to two ESPs, both devices react to the same command. When using Home Asistant, the same status is display for both locks.

When using multiple Nuki devices, different paths for each device have to be configured.<br>
Navigate to "Nuki Configuration" and change the "MQTT Nuki Smartlock Path" or "MQTT Nuki Opener Path" under "Basic Nuki Configuration" for at least one of the devices.<br>

### The Nuki battery is draining quickly.

This often is a result of enabling "Register as app".<br>
Doing so will cause Nuki Hub to constantly query the lock and as such cause excessive battery drain.<br>
To prevent this behaviour, unpair Nuki Hub, disable "Register as app", and re-pair.<br>
<br>
<b>Never enable "Register as app" unless you intend to use a Nuki Bridge in addition to Nuki Hub!</b>
